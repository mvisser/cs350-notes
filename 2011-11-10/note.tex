\section{Scheduling Algorithms}

\subsection{Shortest Job First}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Non-preemptive --- be careful
	\item Could allow starvation for long-running jobs
	\item Requires calculating estimates of CPU burst lengths.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Comparison of Algorithms}

The \emph{average turn-around time} is the time from when a job enters the
system, until when it leaves, \textit{i.e.} the time it waits added to the time
it takes to execute.

\subsection{Priority}

Sometimes we want some processes to have higher priority over others. We give
them a priority level, and put the processes in queues based on their priority.
The problem with this is that threads that have low priority may starve.
